## ✨ About Me

Hey! I'm Marcelle Yanari — a passionate frontend & mobile developer who loves clean code, pastel VSCode themes, and cats.  
I’ve been working with tech since 2019 and I’m always finding creative ways to make apps that are fast, fun, and user-friendly.

This portfolio is where I keep my digital playground — it showcases my latest work, my experience, and gives people an easy way to connect with me.
